            <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
            <p>Michel Adam was born on April 16 in Warsaw and is of Jewish descent. He moved to Vienna in 1958 along with his family. Later he was granted a scholarship for Mathematics at Princeton University. Fashion has always been closer to his heart.
                <br><br> Michel Adam later started his own franchise "love-f-cafe" in various European cities such as Monaco and Milan. He returned to Vienna with the opening of the café on the ground floor of the Hotel Bristol next to the opera house
                in 2013, which became very popular among the fashion community. This café became a popular destination for many fashion shows, afterparties and other fashion events. This is how Michel Adam put the foundation of FashionTV’s massive empire.
